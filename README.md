# power-consumption-analysis

Problem Statement

The company wants to analyze power consumption data over time to understand usage trends, patterns, and unusual spikes. Without this analysis, it is difficult to control costs or plan resources.

 Goal of the Dashboard

The goal of the dashboard is to provide a clear view of electricity usage over different time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly), highlight peak and low consumption times, detect anomalies, and give decision-makers quick KPIs for better energy management.

 Three Visuals Explained

Line chart with rolling average → shows how power consumption changes over time and smooths the trend, making it easy to see long-term patterns.

Heatmap (Day vs Hour) → displays average consumption for every day of the week and hour of the day, helping to identify the busiest times.

STL Decomposition chart → splits the data into Trend, Seasonality, and Residual, so we can see if consumption is increasing overall, repeating in cycles, or has random spikes.
 
 Insights of the Dashboard (Short)

Consumption has clear peaks during certain hours of the day.

Some weekdays show higher usage than weekends.

Recent periods may be higher/lower compared to the past average.

Anomalies highlight sudden spikes or drops that need attention.

5. What a Company Gets With This

Better understanding of when and how energy is used.

Ability to plan operations and reduce electricity costs.

Detect unusual usage early to prevent wastage.

Data-driven decisions for resource allocation and future energy planning.
